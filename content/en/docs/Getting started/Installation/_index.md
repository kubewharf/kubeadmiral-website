## Local installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed in the environment before installing KubeAdmiral:

- [Go](https://go.dev/) version v1.19+
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) version v0.14.0+
- [Kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl) version v0.20.15+

### Installation steps

If you want to understand how KubeAdmiral works, you can easily start a cluster with KubeAdmiral control plane on your local computer.

1.Clone the KubeAdmiral repository to your local environmentï¼š

```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kubewharf/kubeadmiral
```

2.Switch to the KubeAdmiral directory:

```Bash
$ cd kubeadmiral
```

3.Install and start KubeAdmiral:

```Bash
$ make local-up
```

The command performs the following tasks mainly:

- Use the Kind tool to start a meta-cluster;
- Install the KubeAdmiral control plane components on the meta-cluster;
- Use the Kind tool to start 3 member clusters;
- Bootstrap the joining of the 3 member clusters to the federated control plane;
- Export the cluster kubeconfigs to the $HOME/.kube/kubeadmiral directory.

If all the previous steps went successfully, we would see the following message:

```Bash
Your local KubeAdmiral has been deployed successfully!

To start using your KubeAdmiral, run:
  export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/kubeadmiral/kubeadmiral.config
  
To observe the status of KubeAdmiral control-plane components, run:
  export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/kubeadmiral/meta.config

To inspect your member clusters, run one of the following:
  export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/kubeadmiral/member-1.config
  export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/kubeadmiral/member-2.config
  export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/kubeadmiral/member-3.config
```

4.Wait for all member clusters to join KubeAdmiral

After the member clusters have successfully joined KubeAdmiral, we can observe the detailed status of the member clusters through the control plane: three member clusters have joined KubeAdmiral, and their statuses are all READY and JOINED.

```Bash
$ kubectl get fcluster

NAME                   READY   JOINED   AGE
kubeadmiral-member-1   True    True     1m
kubeadmiral-member-2   True    True     1m
kubeadmiral-member-3   True    True     1m
```

## Installation KubeAdmiral by Helm Chart

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed in the environment before installing KubeAdmiral:

- Kubernetes cluster version v1.20.15+
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) version v3+
- [Kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl) version v0.20.15+

### Installation steps

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can install the KubeAdmiral control plane on your cluster using the helm chart. To install KubeAdmiral, follow these steps:

1.Get the Chart package for KubeAdmiral and install it:

Get the Chart package locally and install it.

```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kubewharf/kubeadmiral

$ cd kubeadmiral

$ helm install kubeadmiral -n kubeadmiral-system --create-namespace --dependency-update ./charts/kubeadmiral
```

2.Wait and check if the package has been installed successfully

Use your Kubernetes cluster kubeconfig to see if the following components of KubeAdmiral have been successfully running:

```Bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kubeadmiral-system

NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
etcd-0                                                1/1     Running   0             13h
kubeadmiral-apiserver-5767cd4f56-gvnqq                1/1     Running   0             13h
kubeadmiral-controller-manager-5f598574c9-zjmf9       1/1     Running   0             13h
kubeadmiral-hpa-aggregator-59ccd7b484-phbr6           2/2     Running   0             13h
kubeadmiral-kube-controller-manager-6bd7dcf67-2zpqw   1/1     Running   2 (13h ago)   13h
```

3.Export the kubeconfig of KubeAdmiral

After executing the following command, the kubeconfig for connecting to KubeAdmiral will be exported to the kubeadmiral-kubeconfig file.

> Note that the address in the kubeconfig is set to the internal service address of KubeAdmiral-apiserver:

```Bash
$ kubectl get secret -n kubeadmiral-system kubeadmiral-kubeconfig-secret -o jsonpath={.data.kubeconfig} | base64 -d > kubeadmiral-kubeconfig
```

If you specified an external address when installing KubeAdmiral, we will automatically generate a kubeconfig using the external address. You can export it to the external-kubeadmiral-kubeconfig file by running the following command:

```Bash
$ kubectl get secret -n kubeadmiral-system kubeadmiral-kubeconfig-secret -o jsonpath={.data.external-kubeconfig} | base64 -d > external-kubeadmiral-kubeconfig
```

### Uninstallation steps

Uninstall the KubeAdmiral Helm chart in the kubeadmiral-system namespace:

```Bash
$ helm uninstall -n kubeadmiral-system kubeadmiral 
```

This command will delete all Kubernetes resources associated with the Chart:

> Note: The following permissions and namespace resources are relied on when installing and uninstalling helmchart, so they cannot be deleted automatically and require you to clean them up manually.

```Bash
$ kubectl delete clusterrole kubeadmiral-pre-install-job

$ kubectl delete clusterrolebinding kubeadmiral-pre-install-job

$ kubectl delete ns kubeadmiral-system
```
